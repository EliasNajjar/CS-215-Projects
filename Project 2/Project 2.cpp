/*
 * Course: CS215-09
 * Project: Lab 10 (as the second part of Project 2)
 * Purpose: Testing the definition of Player class.
 *          First, it creates 52 cards on deck (no shuffle)
 *          Second, it deals 26 cards for one player: testPlayer (another 26 cards are put on the pile at table)
 *          Third, testPlayer plays one card from hand, then drop THREE cards from hand
 *          Fourth, testPlayer plays one more card from hand
 *          Then "pretend" testPlayer wins and get FIVE cards on the pile (at the table) and  it displays the cards in testPlayer's hand
 *          Last, display simulation: testPlayer repeatedly plays ONE card, then drops THREE cards,until no more card in hand.
